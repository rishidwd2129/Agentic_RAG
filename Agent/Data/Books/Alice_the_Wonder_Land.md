Preface to the 1897 Edition
Enquiries have been so often addressed to me, as to whether
any answer to the Hatter’s Riddle (see p. 65) can be imag-
ined, that I may as well put on record here what seems to
me to be a fairly appropriate answer, viz. “Because it can
produce a few notes, though they are very flat; and it is never
put with the wrong end in front!” This, however, is merely
an afterthought: the Riddle, as originally invented, had no
answer at all.
For this eighty-sixth thousand, fresh electrotypes have been
taken from the woodblocks (which, never having been used
for printing from, are in as good condition as when first cut
in 1865), and the whole book has been set up afresh with new
type. If the artistic qualities of this reissue fall short, in any
particular, of those possessed by the original issue, it will not
be for want of painstaking on the part of author, publisher
or printer.
I take this opportunity of announcing that the Nursery
“Alice”, hitherto priced at four shillings, net, is now to be
had on the same terms as the ordinary shilling picture books
– although I feel sure that it is, in every quality (except
the text itself, on which I am not qualified to pronounce),
greatly superior to them. Four shillings was a perfectly rea-
sonable price to charge, considering the very heavy initial
outlay I had incurred: still, as the Public have practically

said: “We will not give more than a shilling for a picture
book, however artistically got up”, I am content to reckon
my outlay on the book as so much dead loss, and, rather
than let the little ones, for whom it was written, go without
it, I am selling it at a price which is, to me, much the same
thing as giving it away.
ChristmAs, 1896

[Prefatory poem]
All in the golden afternoon
Full leisurely we glide;
For both our oars, with little skill,
By little arms are plied,
While little hands make vain pretence
Our wanderings to guide.
Ah, cruel Three!* In such an hour,
Beneath such dreamy weather,
To beg a tale of breath too weak
To stir the tiniest feather!
Yet what can one poor voice avail
Against three tongues together?
Imperious Prima flashes forth
Her edict “to begin it”:
In gentler tones Secunda hopes
“There will be nonsense in it!”
While Tertia interrupts the tale
Not more than once a minute.

AliCe’s Adventures in WonderlAnd
Anon, to sudden silence won,
In fancy they pursue
The dream child moving through a land
Of wonders wild and new,
In friendly chat with bird or beast –
And half believe it true.
And ever, as the story drained
The wells of fancy dry,
And faintly strove that weary one
To put the subject by,
“The rest next time—” “It is next time!”
The happy voices cry.
Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:
Thus slowly, one by one,
Its quaint events were hammered out –
And now the tale is done,
And home we steer, a merry crew,
Beneath the setting sun.
Alice! A childish story take,
And, with a gentle hand,
Lay it where Childhood’s dreams are twined
In Memory’s mystic band,
Like pilgrim’s withered wreath of flowers
Plucked in a far-off land.

of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversations?”
So she was considering, in her own mind (as well as she could,
for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
7

the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble
of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice
think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
“Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!” (when she thought it over
afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered
at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but, when the
Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket, and
looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it
flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit
with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it, and,
burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge.
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once con-
sidering how in the world she was to get out again.
The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,
and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had
not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found
herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she
had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to
wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look
down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark
to see anything: then she looked at the sides of the well, and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves:
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed: it was
labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disap-
pointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear

of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one
of the cupboards as she fell past it.
“Well!” thought Alice to herself. “After such a fall as this, I
shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs! How brave they’ll
all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even
if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)
Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I
wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud.
“I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me
see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think…” (for, you
see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the
schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for
showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her,
still it was good practice to say it over) “…yes, that’s about the
right distance – but then I wonder what latitude or longitude I’ve
got to?” (Alice had not the slightest idea what latitude was, or lon-
gitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say.)
Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right
through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the
people that walk with their heads downwards! The antipathies,
I think…” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this
time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “…but I shall
have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
Please, ma’am, is this New Zealand? Or Australia?” (And she
tried to curtsey as she spoke – fancy, curtseying as you’re fall-
ing through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And
what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll
never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice
soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much tonight,
9

## Page 16

AliCe’s Adventures in WonderlAnd
I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember
her saucer of milk at teatime. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were
down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but
you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know.
But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get
rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort
of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes
“Do bats eat cats?” – for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either
question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she
was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and was saying to her,
very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat
a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in
a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead: before
her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in
sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away
went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as
it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s get-
ting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the
Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low
hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
wondering how she was ever to get out again.
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made
of solid glass: there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key,
and Alice’s first idea was that this might belong to one of
10

## Page 17

doWn the rAbbit hole
the doors of the hall;
but – alas! – either the
locks were too large, or
the key was too small,
but at any rate it would
not open any of them.
However, on the second
time round, she came
upon a low curtain she
had not noticed before,
and behind it was a little
door about fifteen inches
high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her
great delight it fitted!
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small
passage, not much larger than a rat hole: she knelt down and
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about
among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains,
but she could not even get her head through the doorway – “and
even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it
would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I
wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way
things had happened lately that Alice had begun to think that
very few things indeed were really impossible.
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so
she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another
key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up
like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it (“which
11

certainly was not here before,”
said Alice), and tied round the
neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words “DRINK
ME” beautifully printed on it in
large letters.
It was all very well to say “Drink
me”, but the wise little Alice was
not going to do that in a hurry.
“No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and
see whether it’s marked ‘poison’
or not”; for she had read several
nice little stories about children
who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other
unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the
simple rules their friends had taught them: such as that a red-
hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that, if
you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds;
and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked “poison”, it is almost certain to disagree with
you sooner or later.
However, this bottle was not marked “poison”, so Alice ven-
tured to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort
of mixed flavour of cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey,
toffee and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off.
« « « «

“What a curious feeling!” said Alice. “I must be shutting up
like a telescope!”

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high,
and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now
the right size for going through the little door into that lovely
garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see
if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nerv-
ous about this – “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to
herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the
flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out,
for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided
on going into the garden at once; but – alas for poor Alice! –
when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little
golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found
she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly
through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the
legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired
herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to her-
self rather sharply. “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She
generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom
followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to
bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box
her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she
was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond
of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought
poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly
enough of me left to make one respectable person.”
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under
the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake,
13

AliCe’s Adventures in WonderlAnd
on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in
currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me
grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow
smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I’ll get into
the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”
She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself “Which way?
Which way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel
which way it was growing; and she was quite surprised to find
that she remained the same size. To be sure, this is what gener-
ally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much
into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things
to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on
in the common way.
So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.
